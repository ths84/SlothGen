## 🦥 Generating some names

Upon starting SlothGen you are able to create a fresh database or work with an existing one. 
The database will provide first and last names to generate a new (and never seen before) name.
<br><br>A sample database with the filename **"database.json"** is already provided and ready to use.
If you want to create a fresh database, SlothGen will first scrape some names from different websites (see below). 
The scraping process will take some time...

## Websites used for building a database

The following websites are currently scraped for building a database for names:

- https://www.vorname.com
